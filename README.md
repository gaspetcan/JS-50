# JS-50

Let’s learn the fundamentals of script building.

## 1. Polymorphism

The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects. As JavaScript is not a type-safe language, we can pass any type of data members with the methods.

Also, Polymorphism is derived from two words <b>poly</b> and <b>morphism</b> which means many and variance of form. In programming, polymorphism is defined as the ability of an object to take on different forms. In the next section, we’ll get a deeper understanding of how JavaScript handles polymorphism.
