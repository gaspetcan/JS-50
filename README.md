### 1. Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the presentation of one interface for multiple data types. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects. As JavaScript is not a type-safe language, we can pass any type of data members with the methods.

[Example with code](https://github.com/gaspetcan/JS-50/blob/main/Docs/1-Polymorphism/index.js)

### 2. Inheritance

With most of the gory details of OOJS now explained, this article shows how to create "child" object classes (constructors) that inherit features from their "parent" classes. In addition, we present some advice on when and where you might use OOJS, and look at how classes are dealt with in modern ECMAScript syntax.

[Example with code](https://github.com/gaspetcan/JS-50/blob/main/Docs/2-Inheritance/index.js)

### 3. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one component (for example, a class) and then controlling access to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the object. Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.

[Example with code](https://github.com/gaspetcan/JS-50/blob/main/Docs/3-Encapsulation/index.js)

### 4. Singleton

The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. This single instance is called the singleton. [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by <b>Robert C. Martin</b>.

[Example with code](https://github.com/gaspetcan/JS-50/blob/main/Docs/4-Singleton/index.js)

### 5. Interfaces

JavaScript uses what's called [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing). If object has quack(), walk(), and fly() methods without requiring the implementation of some "Duckable" interface. The interface is exactly the set of functions that the code uses and the return values from those functions.
